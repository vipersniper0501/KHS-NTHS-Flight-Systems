=========================================================================


Info:
=====
The Moore Flight Computer(MFP) software is desinged to run on the raspberry pi 0 on the MFP to accept the sensor
data from the arduino and stores it in a spreadsheet. The MFP also captures and stores pictures from the raspberry pi 0.

Prerequisits:
=============
1. A completed MFP system(see schematics)
2. Access to the raspberry pi 0 via the peripherals
3. Have the MFP software downloaded

Warnings:
========
1. Ensure that the schematics have been followed properly
2. Be careful running commands as root on the raspberry
4. Follow instalation instructions carefuly 

Installation:
=============
To begin you will need to gain access to the raspberry pi 0 by connecting the peripherals for example. Once you gain access to the 
raspberry pi 0 you will need to download the MFP zip file from "ftp://stephen.iansweb.org/MFP/" and select the latest
version. Once downloaded you will need to unzip the file by using the command, "sudo unzip /example/direcotry/file.zip", 
replacing the relavent information. Cd into the extracted files and unpack the tar.gz file by using the command, 
"sudo tar -xvzf /example/directry/file.tar.gz". Cd into the new directory and run the "install.sh" script by typing
the command, "./install.sh". Note you may need to be root to run this script. If all has gone to according to plan all you
will need to do is reboot the raspberry pi 0 to begin data collection automaticly.
